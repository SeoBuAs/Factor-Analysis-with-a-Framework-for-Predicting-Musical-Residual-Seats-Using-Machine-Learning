# Factor Analysis with a Framework for Predicting Musical Residual Seats Using Machine Learning

### Abstract
The popularity of musical actors is closely related to ticket sales rates. However, the practice of star casting increases production costs, leading to higher ticket prices and reduced accessibility to musicals, creating a continuing vicious cycle. To address this issue, this study identifies key factors influencing ticket sales and proposes a factor analysis method using a machine learning-based framework for predicting remaining musical seats. The proposed framework analyzes which factors significantly influence the prediction of remaining musical seats.\n

To validate this, experiments were conducted using statistical analysis along with nine different machine learning models. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was utilized for factor analysis to interpret the model's prediction results. The Gradient Boosting Regressor model demonstrated the best prediction performance. It was confirmed that the discount rate is the most crucial factor influencing ticket sales.\n

Through the proposed framework, remaining seats can be efficiently predicted, and the most significant factors affecting these predictions are identified.\n
